# 🧠 Engineering Memory Copilot
### AI-powered Organizational Memory using Cognee

> Stop searching documents. Start talking to your organization's memory.

---

## 📖 Overview

Engineering teams generate thousands of documents throughout a project's lifecycle:

- Architecture documents
- Technical specifications
- RFCs
- Incident reports
- Runbooks
- Design documents
- Meeting notes
- API documentation

Over time, this knowledge becomes scattered across different platforms such as Confluence, Google Drive, Notion, SharePoint, GitHub, Jira, Slack, and local storage.

Finding the right information becomes increasingly difficult.

Traditional document search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can retrieve relevant document chunks, but they cannot truly **remember** organizational knowledge or understand relationships between different pieces of information.

Engineering Memory Copilot solves this problem by using **Cognee** to build a persistent organizational memory instead of simply indexing documents.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Organizations lose valuable engineering knowledge because:

- Knowledge is spread across multiple documents.
- Engineers spend hours searching for information.
- Traditional search relies on keyword matching.
- Standard RAG retrieves isolated chunks without understanding relationships.
- Organizational knowledge disappears when experienced engineers leave.

For example, answering:

> Why was PostgreSQL upgraded last year?

may require information from:

- Architecture Decision Records
- Incident Reports
- Migration Guides
- Meeting Notes

A normal RAG system retrieves similar chunks.

Engineering Memory Copilot connects the entire story.

---

# 💡 Solution

Instead of treating documents as isolated chunks, this application builds a living organizational memory.

```

The assistant doesn't just retrieve documents.

It remembers engineering knowledge.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- pip
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- Cognee API credentials
- OpenAI API Key (or compatible LLM provider)

---

# 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/engineering-memory-copilot.git

cd engineering-memory-copilot
```

---

# ⚙️ Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory.

```bash
cd backend
```

## Create Virtual Environment

Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows

```powershell
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory.

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/memory_db

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

COGNEE_API_KEY=your_cognee_api_key

COGNEE_API_URL=https://api.cognee.ai
```

Modify the values according to your environment.

---

## Start PostgreSQL

Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create the database.

Example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE memory_db;
```

---

## Run Database Migrations

If using SQLAlchemy/Alembic:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

If your project creates tables automatically, this step can be skipped.

---

## Start Backend

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will start on

```
http://localhost:8000
```

API documentation

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

# 💻 Frontend Setup

Open another terminal.

```bash
cd frontend
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## Configure Frontend Environment

Create

```
frontend/.env.local
```

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Start Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Application will run at

```
http://localhost:3000

# 🛠 Troubleshooting

## Backend doesn't start

Check:

- Python version
- Virtual environment activated
- Dependencies installed
- Environment variables configured

---

## Database connection failed

Verify:

# 🌟 Why This Project?

Traditional RAG answers:

> "Which paragraph is similar to the question?"

Engineering Memory Copilot answers:

> "What does the organization know about this topic?"

By combining Cognee's persistent memory capabilities with modern LLMs, this project transforms static documentation into an evolving engineering knowledge base that helps teams retain expertise, accelerate onboarding, and make informed technical decisions.
